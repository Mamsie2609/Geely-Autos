# Geely-Autos

Geely Auto, a renowned automobile manufacturer from China, has set its sights on expanding its operations and establishing a manufacturing unit in Nigeria. The company aims to produce cars locally, which will enable them to compete with their Nigerian, American, and European counterparts effectively. This is a strategic move by the company, as Nigeria has a massive automobile market that presents a promising opportunity for growth and expansion.

To achieve this goal, Geely Auto recognizes the importance of gaining a deep understanding of the Nigerian automobile market and the factors that influence car pricing in the region. To this end, I will be conducting an extensive exploratory analysis on a dataset of various car types that are currently prevalent in the Nigerian market. This dataset will be obtained from a range of market surveys and other relevant sources.

The primary objective of this project is to provide the company with valuable insights into the Nigerian automobile market, particularly the factors that influence car pricing. By analyzing this data, I aim to provide comprehensive and detailed information on the various factors that affect car prices in Nigeria. This will include an analysis of the demand and supply dynamics in the market.

In summary, this project is designed to provide Geely Auto with critical information and insights that will enable the company to make informed decisions about its entry into the Nigerian automobile market. By leveraging the information and insights provided in this analysis, Geely Auto will be well-positioned to establish a successful manufacturing unit in Nigeria and compete effectively with other players in the market.
